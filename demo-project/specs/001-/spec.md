## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to create an account and securely access the system so that I can use the application's features with my personal data protected.

As an existing user, I want to log in with my credentials and have my session persist across visits, while being able to securely log out when needed.

As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset it securely without losing access to my account.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Registration Flow**
1. **Given** I am a new user on the registration page, **When** I provide valid email and password, **Then** my account is created and I receive a confirmation
2. **Given** I am registering with an email already in use, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I see an error message indicating the email is already registered
3. **Given** I provide a weak password, **When** I attempt to register, **Then** I see password strength requirements and cannot proceed

**Login Flow**
4. **Given** I have a valid, verified account, **When** I enter correct credentials, **Then** I receive a JWT access token and refresh token, and am redirected to the application
5. **Given** I enter incorrect password, **When** I submit login form, **Then** I see a generic error message (not revealing which field is wrong)
6. **Given** I have 5 failed login attempts, **When** I try to log in again, **Then** my account is temporarily locked for 30 minutes

**Session Management (JWT Token)**
7. **Given** I am logged in with a valid JWT token, **When** I make an authenticated request, **Then** the system validates my token and grants access
8. **Given** my JWT access token has expired, **When** I make a request, **Then** I can use my refresh token to obtain a new access token
9. **Given** I explicitly log out, **When** I try to use my previously valid token, **Then** the token is rejected as revoked

**Password Reset Flow**
10. **Given** I forgot my password, **When** I request a reset, **Then** I receive a secure reset link via email valid for 1 hour
11. **Given** I have a reset link, **When** I click it after 1 hour has passed, **Then** I see an expiration message and must request a new reset link
12. **Given** I use a valid reset link, **When** I set a new password, **Then** all existing JWT tokens are invalidated and I must log in again

**Email Verification Flow**
13. **Given** I just registered, **When** I check my email, **Then** I receive a verification link valid for 24 hours
14. **Given** I click the verification link, **When** it's still valid, **Then** my account is activated and I can log in
15. **Given** my verification link expired, **When** I try to log in, **Then** I'm prompted to request a new verification email

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to register with special characters in email? (Should be validated according to RFC 5322)
- How does the system handle concurrent login sessions from different devices? (Multiple JWT tokens allowed)
- What happens if a user's email service is down during password reset? (Token generated, email fails - user can retry)
- How are deleted/disabled accounts handled during login attempts? (Generic error, no indication account is disabled)
- What happens if someone tries to use an expired JWT token? (401 Unauthorized, prompt to refresh)
- What happens if someone tries to use a JWT token after password change? (Token revoked, must re-authenticate)
- How does the system handle refresh token theft? (Rotation strategy - issue new refresh token on use)
- What happens during race conditions with concurrent password resets? (Latest valid token wins, others invalidated)
- How does the system handle brute force attacks? (Rate limiting + account lockout)
- What happens if verification email is requested multiple times? (Previous tokens can be invalidated, or allow multiple active tokens)
- How are malformed JWT tokens handled? (Rejected with 401, logged as security event)
- What happens when JWT signing key is rotated? (Gradual migration, support both old and new keys temporarily)

## Technical Constraints (for Planning Phase)

*Note: These are technical constraints that should guide the planning phase, not implementation details in the spec.*

- **Authentication Method**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication
- **Password Storage**: Strong cryptographic hashing (bcrypt/Argon2/PBKDF2)
- **Session Management**: Token-based with refresh token mechanism
- **Email Service**: Required for verification and password reset
- **Security**: HTTPS required, protection against CSRF/XSS/SQL injection

---

## Next Steps

**Status**: ✅✅ **FULLY SPECIFIED - Ready for /plan**

The specification is 100% complete with ALL clarifications resolved:
- ✅ Password policy: Configurable Basic/High security levels
- ✅ JWT expiration: 1 hour access, 7 day refresh tokens
- ✅ GDPR compliance: Full data protection requirements specified

**Next Action**: Run `/plan` to generate the implementation plan

**Estimated Complexity**: **Medium-High** 
- Authentication is security-critical and requires careful implementation
- JWT token management with rotation adds complexity
- Email integration required (verification + password reset)
- Comprehensive security logging and monitoring needed
- Multiple edge cases to handle (account lockout, token expiration, concurrent sessions, etc.)
- GDPR compliance requirements (user data rights, consent tracking)
- Configurable password policies add flexibility but require admin interface
