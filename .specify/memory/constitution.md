# Demo Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All code must be test-first.**

- Tests MUST be written before implementation code
- Tests MUST be approved by the user/reviewer before implementation begins
- Follow strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. Write failing test (Red)
  2. Write minimal code to pass (Green)
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green
- No feature is complete without comprehensive test coverage
- Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for system interactions

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness, maintainability, and provides living documentation. It prevents regression bugs and encourages better design.

### II. Code Quality & Standards

**Code must meet high quality standards.**

- All code MUST pass linting and formatting checks
- Follow language-specific best practices and style guides
- Code MUST be readable and self-documenting
- Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments
- No code merges without passing CI/CD quality gates
- Use static type checking where applicable

**Rationale**: Consistent, high-quality code reduces bugs, eases maintenance, and improves team collaboration.

### III. Documentation First

**Every feature requires clear documentation.**

- All public APIs MUST have comprehensive documentation
- Feature specifications MUST be written before implementation
- README files MUST be kept up-to-date
- Complex algorithms MUST include explanation comments
- Change logs MUST document all significant changes
- Include examples and usage patterns

**Rationale**: Good documentation reduces onboarding time, prevents misuse, and serves as a contract for system behavior.

### IV. Performance & User Experience

**Build with performance and UX in mind.**

- Optimize for user-perceived performance
- Measure and monitor key performance metrics
- Avoid premature optimization, but be performance-aware
- Responsive design for all user interfaces
- Accessible (a11y) by default
- Graceful degradation and error handling

**Rationale**: Users expect fast, smooth experiences. Performance issues drive users away and damage reputation.

### V. Security & Privacy

**Security and privacy are foundational, not optional.**

- All user input MUST be validated and sanitized
- Use secure defaults and fail safely
- Never store sensitive data in plain text
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Privacy by design - collect minimal necessary data
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

**Rationale**: Security breaches and privacy violations have severe consequences. Building security in from the start is far easier than retrofitting.

## Development Workflow

**Structured development process for consistency.**

- Use Spec-Kit workflow: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
- Feature branches for all new work
- Code review required before merging
- Continuous Integration (CI) must pass before merge
- Semantic versioning for all releases
- Clear commit messages following conventional commits format

## Quality Gates

**Automated and manual checks ensure quality.**

- **Pre-commit**: Linting, formatting, type checking
- **CI Pipeline**: All tests pass, code coverage meets threshold
- **Code Review**: At least one approval required, constitution compliance verified
- **Pre-release**: Integration tests pass, documentation updated
- **Post-release**: Monitor metrics, gather feedback

## Governance

**This constitution is the foundation of all development practices.**

- All development decisions MUST align with these principles
- Principle violations require explicit justification and approval
- Amendments require:
  1. Documented rationale
  2. Team discussion and approval
  3. Version increment (MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications)
  4. Update to all dependent templates and documentation
- When in doubt, refer back to these principles
- Quality and user value trump speed
